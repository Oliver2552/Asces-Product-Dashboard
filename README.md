SUBJECT: Request for Dashboard Development: Product Analysis Overview

Dear Data Analyst,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to request the development of a high-level product analytics dashboard that provides insights into key product performance metrics. This dashboard will serve to support strategic decision-making and allow us to track performance trends effectively.

Key questions the dashboard must answer: What are the top-performing regions with corresponding revenue? What are the date-comparative trends? What is a high-level summary of growth? How are our discount categories performing? What are the revenue and profit details by country and year? Include any additional insights you see fit.


Best,

Your Boss
